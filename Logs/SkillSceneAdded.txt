            medium: 5
            hard: 3 (so that you have to leave at least one skill at base level)
    + Scene for skills initial level selection S

+ descriptions for block of codes (they are "kinda" categorized, didn't want to mess too much with the code)

~ added new background
    ~ new path within game folder
~ fixed checkstyle
    ~ Capital letters
    ~ spaces
    ~ indentations
    ~ names
    ~ imports
    ~ what I could fix has been fixed, stuff not fixed:
        ~ throw error javaDoc descriptions
        ~ javaDocs

? clues on how to fix the flash at every change of scene?
    currently the backgorund is loaded before lunch() in primary.Main.java
    then the ImageView is created at the beginning of primary.NewGame.java, however the canvas flashes at every change of scene
    might be due to the resizing to fit pane size (which happens at each change of scene)
    No idea of what else we can try

! LoadGraphics method
! Comments to separate nodes for each scene
! Thomas should fix names of varibales so that they make more sense (scene navgation, layouts etc.)

TO DO:
    - add icon for each skill above skill title
    - better way to update the skill level than recalling the scene
